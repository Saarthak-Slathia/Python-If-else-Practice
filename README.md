# Python If-else Practice Questions
These are some practice questions regarding if-else statements in Python with Questions and their Solutions.

    '''
    Problems:
    Write the conditional expression for the following:-
        1. Create a variable "a" whose value depends on the input of the user and develop a logic that if the value of a is less than 10, then set the value of variable "b" as 20 and print it, or else set the value of b as 40 and print it. [Print the values using formated ("f") strings.]
        2. Create a variable "time" whose value depends on the time entered in the form of integers inputed by the user and create a logic that checks:
            if the value of "time" is less than 12, print "Good Morning"
            if the value of "time" is more than 24, print "Invalid Input !!!"
            else, print "Good Afternoon"
        3. Create a variable "marks" which takes input from the user in form of integers of their marks and develop a logic that:
            if the value of marks is equal-to or greater than 75, print True.
            if the value of marks at the same time is greater than 100, print "Invalid Input !".
            else, print False.
